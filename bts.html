				<strong>How the Game works</strong>
					<p>New World is an MMORPG developed by Amazon Games that utilizes both client-side and server-side technology to deliver a seamless gaming experience. On the server side, the game runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS), a cutting-edge cloud network infrastructure that allows the studio to host up to 10,000 players per server. The game’s developers used a unique architecture built around different instances of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), which provides secure and resizable compute capacity for virtually any workload.</p>
					<p>On the client side, there is a lot going on graphically to deliver an immersive gaming experience 3. The game’s client technology is responsible for rendering the game’s graphics, processing user input, and communicating with the game’s servers.</p>
					<p>Together, these technologies allow New World to deliver a seamless and immersive gaming experience to players. The game’s servers handle the complex computations required to simulate the game’s virtual world, while the client technology delivers high-quality graphics and responsive gameplay.</p>
				<strong>How our Virtual World Is being used</strong>
					<p>New World is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by Amazon Games and released in September 2021. In the game, players create custom characters and enter an expansive, supernatural realm called Aeternum, where they can interact with thousands of other virtual adventurers.</p>
					<p>The game’s developers used Amazon Web Services (AWS) solutions to create a seamless user experience while maintaining and operating a backend structure that keeps the game available virtually 24/7 globally. The game’s architecture is built around different instances of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), which provides secure and resizable computing capacity for virtually any workload.</p>
					<p>As players move through the game, state information is handed from hub instance to hub instance, spreading the compute load over virtual servers hosted globally in multiple AWS Regions. This allows for a seamless and immersive experience for players as they explore the virtual world of Aeternum.</p>
					<p>In addition to exploring the virtual world, players can also participate in session-based modes, where they can take part in temporary adventures. These sessions are powered by a separate pool of hubs shared based on availability.</p>
					<p>Overall, the use of virtual worlds in New World allows for an immersive and engaging gaming experience, where players can explore a vast and detailed world, interact with other players, and engage in a variety of activities and adventures.</p>

				<strong>Social and ethical Issues</strong>	
					<p><strong>Copyright</strong> is a legal right that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to its use and distribution. When creating an MMORPG, it is vital to ensure that all content used in the game, including graphics, music, and code, is either created by the game developers or properly licensed by the original creators. Failure to do so can result in legal action and financial penalties.</p>
					<p><strong>Privacy</strong> is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves from others. When creating an MMORPG, it is important to ensure that players’ personal information is protected and not shared without their consent. This includes information such as their real name, address, and payment information. It is also important to have clear privacy policies in place and to follow all relevant privacy laws.
</p>
					<p><strong>Accuracy of data</strong> refers to the correctness and reliability of the data being used. When creating an MMORPG, it is important to ensure that any data used in the game, such as player statistics or game mechanics, is accurate and reliable. This can help to ensure a fair and enjoyable gaming experience for all players.</p>
					<p>In addition to the above, it is also important to consider the following when creating an MMORPG:</p>
					<ul>
					<li><strong>User experience:</strong> The user experience (UX) is the overall experience that a user has when interacting with a product or service. When creating an MMORPG, it is important to focus on creating a positive UX for players. This includes things like making the game easy to learn and navigate, providing clear and concise instructions, and offering a variety of features and activities that players can enjoy.</li>
					<li><strong>Game balance:</strong> Game balance is the state of a game in which all of the elements are working together in a fair and competitive way. When creating an MMORPG, it is important to carefully balance the game's mechanics, items, and characters. This will help to ensure that all players have a chance to succeed and that the game is enjoyable for everyone.</li>
					<li><strong>Content updates:</strong> MMORPGs are constantly evolving games, and it is important to keep the content fresh and exciting for players. This can be done by adding new features, areas, and quests to the game on a regular basis.</li>
					<li><strong>Community:</strong> A strong community is essential for any MMORPG. When creating an MMORPG, it is important to foster a positive and welcoming community for players. This can be done by providing forums, chat rooms, and other social features where players can interact with each other.</li>
</ul><hr />
				<strong>Our goals for the future</strong>	
					<p>A future goal for a company that makes non-subscription based MMORPGs could be to continue to develop and release new, innovative, and engaging games that attract a large and diverse player base. We will focus on creating immersive worlds with rich lore and dynamic gameplay, as well as providing regular updates and expansions to keep players engaged. Additionally, our company will explore new revenue streams such as in-game purchases or partnerships with other companies to ensure financial stability while maintaining a non-subscription model. Ultimately, our goal will be to establish the company as a leader in the MMORPG market and to continue to provide high-quality gaming experiences for players around the world.</p>
