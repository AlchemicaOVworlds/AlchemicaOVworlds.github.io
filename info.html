								<h3>What is New world</h3>
								<p>what our game is about</p>
							</header>
							<p>New World is an MMORPG set in a fictional world during the 17th century during the Age of Exploration. The game is set on a fictional island in the Atlantic Ocean known as Aeternum. The world is filled with resources to gather and enemies to face, from fierce creatures to rival players. At the moment, the player is able to traverse this world by only by foot or via teleportation between "Shrines" located in all major settlements and different landmarks. It has a player-driven economy.</p>
							<p>The economy centers around gold coins. The player can dispose of unwanted items through market between players in exchange for gold coins, they can "salvage" (dismantle) the items for resources, they can discard the item on to the ground, or they can make a direct trade with another player. Characters that die do not drop items, but with each combat encounter, use, or death, the player's items undergo damage. This damage can be repaired with repair items and gold coins.</P>
							<p>The character levels up personal attribute skills. Diminishing returns scale as an attribute's skill level increases. The player's character also levels up weapon and trade skills. The trade skills are divided into the three categories of "crafting" (weapon smithing, armoring, engineering, jewel crafting, arcana, cooking, and furnishing), "refining" (smelting, woodworking, leather working, weaving, and stone cutting), and "gathering" (logging, mining, harvesting, and tracking and skinning). There is also a "camping" skill (wilderness survival).</p>
							<p>Three quick travel methods exist and, although no fast speed mounts are available, there is a set of skills for intermittent forward speed boosts. The player may dodge or climb most environmental objects or use the fire staff to cross large aerial spaces.</p>

								<h4>Virtual Worlds</h4>
								<p>and why we made our game one</p>
							</header>
							<p>An MMORPG like New World is an example of an online/virtual world because it allows players to interact with each other in a shared virtual space. Players can create their own characters, form social connections, and engage in activities together. The game’s virtual world is persistent, meaning that it continues to exist and evolve even when individual players are not logged in. This creates a sense of a living, breathing world for players to explore and inhabit.</p>

								<h4>Community Interaction</h4>
								<p>and what were doing to encourage it</p>
							</header>
							<p>New World has several community-focused features that encourage interaction among players. For example, the game offers PvP events such as Outpost Rush and 3v3 Arenas, where players can compete against each other. There are also community Q&As on topics like New World’s client performance, where players can share their experiences and learn from each other.</p>
							<p>The game also has a persistent virtual world that continues to exist and evolve even when individual players are not logged in. This creates a sense of a living, breathing world for players to explore and inhabit together. Players can form social connections, join forces to take on challenging content, and engage in activities together.</p>
							<p>These features encourage community interaction by providing opportunities for players to collaborate, compete, and communicate with each other. By participating in these activities, players can form bonds with others and become part of the game’s vibrant community.</p>
							<p>An example of community interaction in the game can see viewed through this gameplay of outpost rush featuring an audio of the teams comms during a war.</p>
